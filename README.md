Humble attempt to fork Zimbra project

# FAQ about maldua-project
## What about the maldua name?
The [@ (at) symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign) is called:
 - **Mal**pa in Polish language.
 - Bil**dua** in Basque language.
 
 You mix the two of them and **maldua** appears.
 As a bonus maldua was not a github username.
 
 The maldua name is just an excuse to be able to name this mirror/fork project.
 
 I'm sure that a better name will be choosen in the future if this is no longer a **humble** attempt.
