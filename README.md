Humble attempt to fork Zimbra project

# FAQ about maldua-project
## What about the maldua name?
The [@ (at) symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign) is called:
 - **Mal**pa in Polish language.
 - Bil**dua** in Basque language.
 
 You mix the two of them and **maldua** appears.
 As a bonus maldua was not a github username.
 
 The maldua name is just an excuse to be able to name this mirror/fork project.
 
 I'm sure that a better name will be choosen in the future if this is no longer a **humble** attempt.
## If you want to maintain a fork you need people and money
 For now, the fork will be kept on the technical side. Later on we might seek for money.
## Current ZCS 8.8.x needs help
 - Q: Current ZCS 8.8.x versions need help on adding stuff, improving security and integration with third party tools. You might want to focus your effort there.
 - A: Getting up and running a fork is not done in one month. I prefer to focus on the fork so that we can ready in a few years.
## Is Zimbra X not being suitable for on-premise the main concern?
  - Q: My main concern is that Zimbra 8.8.x which it is on-premise will be deprecated. Synacor might focus its development power into Zimbra X and on-premise might die. Is it also the reason for starting this fork?
  - A: Not at all. We are quite convinced that you will be able to deploy Zimbra X on-premise despite you having to invert on some virtualisation improvements. Anyways, our main concern is Zimbra X not becoming open source on a first step and much later on Zimbra 8.8.x also not keeping its open source license.
  - A: Being able to use Zimbra on-premise is secondary. Once Zimbra on-premise is no longer open source the Zimbra product will no longer be competing to equivalent open source products. Instead it will be competing to both privative and open source products. Many more improvements than current features will be needed to be a competitive product in that new market.
